Actually, I'm not. I just typed that title without paying attention.

What I am going to do instead is attempt to post every week in 2011.

<begin template>  

I've decided I want to blog more. Rather than just thinking about doing it,
I'm starting right now. I will be posting on this blog <del>once a day /</del>
once a week for all of 2011._

  

_I know it won't be easy, but it might be fun, inspiring, awesome and
wonderful. Therefore Iâ€™m promising to make use of [The
DailyPost](http://dailypost.wordpress.com/), and the community of other
bloggers with similiar goals, to help me along the way, including asking for
help when I need it and encouraging others when I can._

_If you already read my blog, I hope you'll encourage me with comments and
likes, and good will along the way._

A nudge or post idea every now and then would help the cause immensely. I'll
try to do more than once a week, but once a day is outright impossible. If
things turn out okay, then that means that I have 52 topics to think about, 52
titles and hopefully 52 spikes on my stats pages.

Actually, make that 51.
