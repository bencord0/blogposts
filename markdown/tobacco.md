Hey, did anyone notice this?

Apparently, this coming April, large supermarkets are no longer allowed to
display tobacco products.

Not that I am a smoker, but I can see how this goes. Smoking, at least in the
UK is not illegal, but it is heavily frowned upon in many social environments.
The day to day smoker is tolerated, it is expected that they will eventually
quit or have accepted the personal consequences.

Enforcing a law that outright bans smoking (tobacco or other) is something
that would be completely impractical. A social ban and stigmatization [1] of
the act is a much better way to "eradicate" smoking via social engineering.
Sweet.

Smaller shops, newsagents are exempt until 2015.

[1] Apparently that's a word according to my spell checker.
