Sorry for the pun.  
  
Apparently, a lot of you have been poking around the links.

Looking at the stats page hosting the maze, peaks in the bandwidth usage
correlates to my blog posts almost exactly. I've hidden some things in the
maze over years, have fun searching for them.

If there's anything you want to add into it, send it to me and specify where
you want it to go. Otherwise I'll just pick somewhere random.

I have rules about what goes in, but the T&Cs are very unusual so I won't even
tell you what they are.
