Finally got round to doing something that I've been threatening to do for a
while.

Now, my precious books can have a place by my side and the tragedy of
Christmas '08 need never be repeated. Respect must be given to books, they are
made of paper and require our attention to keep them healthy and alive.
Moreover, they need to be read.

At the moment, only a small selection of my library is with me, the rest is
kept under guard at home home. I hope to migrate them here at their earliest
convenience. After a quick round of measurements and searching online
catalogs, I actually have room for one and a half bookshelves.
