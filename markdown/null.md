Happy New Year

Firstly, an apology for not posting things here for a while. It's not that I
haven't run out of topics to rant on about, or the lack of anything really new
in the tech world in the run-up for Christmas. I could talk to you about
Chromebooks success, or my exploits on EC2 (build servers for raspberry pis).

I have tried to write my mind down in a format that will translate well to
blog format, but there are so many things going on in my life right now that
stuff [#atwork ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23atwork)is really taking over
my thoughts.

So, here's what I'm going to do.

Before I infringe any secrets, really, really big secrets. I'm putting this
blog on hold for a few months. When I come back, you should expect more
sysadmin tidbits, and other fun geeky stuff.

In the meantime, I have a few travel arrangements to make. If you know me on
[the](http://twitter.com/bencord0) [social](http://facebook.com/b.m.cordero)
[nets](https://plus.google.com/108129802064007840606), ask me for details. If
you've stumbled your way here, through the search engines or other
hyperlinking, feel free to browse the archives and comment here on what you
would like to see post-hiatus.
