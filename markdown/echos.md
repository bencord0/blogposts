_It started off as a reply to the usual Spotify vs Last.fm debate on teh
social networks recently. When my reply was getting longer than the rest of
the thread, I decided that it should probably belong here._

In context, Spotify is doing the rounds in the media and social networks for
reducing their ad-free listening time[1]. In short, for services that one
would use... they're asking for £5 a month.

Personally, I'm in the Last.fm camp.  
  
It's £3 for unrestricted listening. Free accounts let you do (almost)
everything, access to some free songs provided by kind artists, full streams
using the desktop app (which actually just downloads a normal MP3) and a full
api to complement other on-demand services such as grooveshark, amazonMP3 and
for local/network files, Media Player/VLC support. I also supports scrobbling
from Spotify too, jus' sayin'. It won't cut you off from music after 600
minutes in a month.

On Friday, free accounts will notice a few ads, but no requirement to commit
in the UK. There's a list of alternatives at [2]. I might have a look at
hypemachine, not sure what their model is, but there's a large full width
banner saying that it makes last.fm awesome. Their adjective, not mine.

For free, (in the UK) you can stream directly from the last.fm radio service.
Pick by artist, tag or user and you are brought into an auto-generated
playlist. Once there, your options are to listen, enjoy (and love) the tune,
skip to another track of similar audio properties (maybe you've just heard
that song too much today), ban the track from ever descending your ears again
(this has consequences). As of [3], you can even pause tracks too, yes an
announcement was necessary[4].

There's even an open source[5] desktop client (written in Qt. Yay!), and
corresponding ebuild[6].

The last.fm API is extensive[7]. It's well documented, the desktop scrobbler
serves as a very good example/reference implementation for the API. There are
many creative ideas that can be spawned from the API[8], some are quite
exciting. You are even protected from vendor lock-in[9] and are free to do
what you want with your data.

The people behind last.fm aren't that evil. They know that people don't like
to pay for something that they previously got for free, but they need money
too. If you want some of it, they are hiring[10].

10 hours in a month is a lot for a mobile contract. Not that good for music
browsing. In a 30 day month, that is 1 hour for 3 days, or 20 mins per day.
That's enough to get me into work, but leaves me deaf for the road back.

I've been with last.fm since the beta, they gave me a few months free
subscription. If I'm being honest, it's been really useful having unrestricted
access. With a subscription, you can stream to mobile and dedicated
hardware[11].

For £3 a month, unrestricted listening on any device, serendipity in the form
of artist profiles and social networks and integration across the board, it's
a good deal.
