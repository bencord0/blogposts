Hi everyone,

My windows laptop just crashed, but you all should know that I managed to
churn out this raspberry pi kernel in time.

It's 16M, similar to the emergency kernel with a custom init.

Just boot it, remove the SD card and admire that it hasn't crashed.

I think there are some cool things to follow up with this.

Happy Weekend.
