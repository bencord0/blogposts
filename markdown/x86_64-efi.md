Hi future me, just a reminder that you forgot this last time. But booting a
mactel doesn't need special "bless"ing. Just remember to install grub2
properly.

    grub2-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --removable --modules=part_gpt  

Also, grub2 doesn't seem to come with vbe.mod anymore. So on Calculate Linux,
edit /etc/default/grub and change GRUB_VIDEO_BACKEND="vbe" to something
sensible. Perhaps "all_video". Then re-run grub2-mkconfig.
