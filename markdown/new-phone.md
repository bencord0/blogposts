Hey hey, my dear readers. My new phone has arrived. It's quite cool.

It came in the smallest of boxes.  
Besides the paperwork to keep the lawyers happy, there was no comprehensive
technical manual.  
The only paperwork worth reading, besids the box itself, was a small quick
start guide. It points at all of the hardware buttons, the various bits of
transportation plastic to remove, and the order to push buttons the first time
you turn it on.

The majority of setup is left to the step-by-step setup app and exploring. I
think this is a good thing, keeps the wow prolonged. It also helps so that
[HTC](http://www.htc.com) don't have to list a bunch of supported features
that people will bug them about when it breaks.

I like [Nokia](http://nokia.com), the N97 mini served me well, but it was the
holding pattern before I could get hold of a proper [smart
phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone). Unfortunatly, the meego anti-
iphone written with [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/) and made of win did not exist
when upgrade time for that phone came to me. One upgrade cycle later and it
still isn't here. Our dear friends in finland are up to something good,but it
just isn't ready at the moment.

HTC however, are ready.

I'll post more when I explore a little deeper.
