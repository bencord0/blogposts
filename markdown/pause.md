Yes yes, I know it has almost been a month since my last post, but honestly my
dear readers, nothing of real note has happened. Much.  
  
#### Me
  
At the moment I'm waiting on a whole slew of things to happen first so that I
can react to them. There is the topic secrecy (not really much of a secret
now), waiting for official people to do official things. There are meet ups
and social gatherings, but the ones of note all happen next month. For now all
I can do is prepare and buy presents.  

#### Not me
  
Yes, I know about the Nokia thing (N9 and N950 announce) and I know about the
Google thing (Chromebook released) but since neither of these things make a
difference to UK residents, I will ignore them for now.

I wish more people did these OneClickFlashers. Makes openness easier to
understand.

The nice thing about the Chromebook and it's ChromeOS base is that they are
Gentoo underneath. I know how to deal with that.  

#### Almost me

Juniper has gone through a few changes. I have decided that it is just too
powerful to sustain just one OS, I can't make the most of it that way.
Solution: VMware vSphere Hypervisor, the free version of the full thing. But
that probably deserves a post of it's own when I get the parts in. I'll say
more then.

Parsley has a webserver, and I might consider putting a VPN on it. I also
tried a bit of web development, remind me never to do that again. I'll push
some code to gitorious at some point.
