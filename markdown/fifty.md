Ahh well, 2011 is coming to an end and I've been a bit lax on the blogy posty
thing.

Wordpress tells me that this is blog post number 50. Minus the dozen of posts
that pre-date 2011, I think that means that I was mostly [1] successful
sticking to the postaweek principles. I gave up quickly on the official topic
ideas, other people's blogs seemed much more interesting. I would have ended
up reblogging those verbatim or just linking them. A job for twitter no doubt.

I've had over a thousand views over all time with my busiest months around
summer with a lull from October when I ran out of random (yet publishable)
thoughts in my head. I do have a stack of drafts, and incomplete text files
hiding in various hard drives and emails sent to myself. Alas, they are too
fragmented even for this blog to have any meaning at all, or make sense on a
second read.

Plans for the next year [2]? Probably not stick to any predefined blogging
schedule and just spew out fragments and ideas whenever I'm close enough to a
text editor to jot them down.

Ideas, comments, other blogs and idea spawners welcome. There are some life
events expected to occur in the early months of next year, but we'll see what
happens. I'll share in time. T'all good for now.

This summary of the year is also an excuse to tick the "This post is super-
awesome" check box.

[1] from a technical definition of the word.  
[2] new->next, implies it will last longer than 6 or 7 months.
