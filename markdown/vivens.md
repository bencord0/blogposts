### Not dead.  
Not dying.

I know this has been a bit quiet recently, and I know that I have promising
content on the way. You know I have promising content on the way too since
there are a few unfinished topics floating around in the history of this blog.

There are some things that I need to update you on. New hardware and software
that have come across my path. New locations, feelings attitudes and
approaches that I have stumbled into.  
All of these things are very good subject material I have just avoided sitting
down and writing them out.

One of the biggest contribution to the lack of new content is probably by
inability to string a paragraph together which consists with slightly more

Is it because I have don't have enough time on my hands as I used to? Not
really, but I definitely haven't managed my time that well. Most of that I
blame to the fact that I'm living each day on a week by week basis.

I blame lawyers. You'll understand soon. I can't explain it right now since
'the secret event' still hasn't occurred. When the lawyers get their act
together and give the green light, then I'll be able to extend to you what's
been happening.

Things like this happen when anyone keeps secrets. Deal with it, keep checking
back here or prod me on the social networks (thanks H)[1]. Until I have my own
hole to hide in, I won't publicly declare it to the whole world yet.

As is the nature of keeping secrets, I shan't say much about details here.
Prod me in the social networks or the comments below. We'll figure something
out (thanks H)[1].

So, Not dead. I'm still gathering some resources and services. I'm sure
there's going to be some announcement. Hopefully before my next birthday.
