It has finally occurred to me that I should start a blog. Somewhere on the
internet that I can call home. My anchor to the web used to be an email
address; then we all got sidetracked with certain [social
networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network). Now, my place is here.

Anyone know the cyber equivalent to a house warming?

[DDOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) doesn't count.
