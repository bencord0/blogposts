There are some words that can provide a large contrast to different people,
yet still mean the same thing.

For example, "[empirical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical)". Def:
Verifiable or provable by means of observation or experiment.

If a philosopher[1] finds empirical evidence for their theories, it is
considered a great accomplishment. It is reassurance that the threads of
thought they weave can come together to make a t-shirt.

Conversely, if my physicist friends find an empirical formula, even if it
fulfils science[2], there is still a feeling of uneasiness. Until a
mathematician friend can come along to formalise what is no less than
universal suspicions, there is always some doubt.

[1] my philosopher friends, please correct me if I am wrong.  
[2] testable, repeatable, consistent results.
