Looks like dev-lang/python:3.4 is in Gentoo's portage tree. Currently masked
for testing.

Big things that I've been waiting for include the new asyncio module in the
standard library, ensurepip and pip automatically included in virtualenvs, and
some funny corner cases with subprocesses.

Currently, the in-tree version is the RC1, but RC2 was released two days
ago[1].
