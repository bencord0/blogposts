The divergence starts with a breakthrough in 1952.

A direct consequence of which,  
the average human lifespan exceeds the century. Previous to this, Michael Bay  
showed us his Utopian facility, but that screenplay trades raw emotion and
humanity with shallow thrills of the chase, and explosions to keep western
patriots happy.

Here, there is background about how the subjects grew up, their education and
upbringing. Recipients are people, and every member of society benefits, not
just the special few. There are hints of a moral driving force, once the 1952
breakthrough exists, who would stop it? Many live on to longer lives and
crippling degenerative diseases are eradicated.

The movie goes through phases, the childhood unknown, the adolescent
acceptance, the process at adulthood.

Of course, there is the deferral. The twist of drama to move the storey along.
The love to live for, and the rebellion from the destiny of completion. This is
a story sacrifice. The happiness it spawns, and the sadness that dawns.

The disproportion of facsimile selection. There are no escapes.
